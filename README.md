# PickTheBus

This is basically a Bus Tracking application on Android. 
It will get details from the database which located on a online server and track your coordinates using Google API and share it
using JSON with others who use this application.
Basically the sending your locations using JSON , to others is done by PubNub server.

Still under development.
